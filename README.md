<h1>Effects of Banning Informal Attendance on Newborn Health in Malawi</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The government of Malawi, one of the African countries that has the highest maternal mortality ratio (currently 439 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), introduced a controversial ban on informal birth attendants in 2007 in order to alter local household health. Godlonton and Okeke, authors of the original paper, applied a difference-in-difference strategy, which found a 15% decline in the use of traditional attendants, and no statistically significant evidence showing that the newborn mortality rate had been reduced by the new controversial ban.


By doubting whether the ban has no positive effect on newborn health, we extended the original paper from two aspects. First, we performed a robustness check and found that the newborn death rate, the original response variable, does not strictly follow the parallel assumption. Thus, in order to estimate the causal effect of the ban law more accurately, we chose newborn weight instead of mortality rate as an alternative indicator of health. Although the parallel assumption is valid under the new measurement, we found a weak causal relationship between the restrictions on informal providers and newborn weight.

Recall the original paper where the authors were using the data from the 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey. Although the large shift from the informal to formal sector demonstrates some effects of the ban policy, it does not transfer into reductions in newborn mortality. Due to the lack of significant improvements in newborn outcomes, we transfer to our second extension. We conducted an OLS regression examining whether there is a difference between formal and informal in the health of newborns in 2010 and 2015-16. As a result, the probability of a baby born with a healthy weight increased significantly according to the 2015-16 data. Considering the increase in medical expenditure(about 77% from 2010 to 2016), the quality of the formal providers might also increase in the long run, which suggests that when adequate medical quality is ensured, the effectiveness of the policy on health outcomes will gradually be revealed.
